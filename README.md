# Expript
This is the original code for Expript. This version is very poorly coded. There are certainly many bugs and issues. I do not recommend using this version at all. I suggest using [Expript2](https://github.com/Germax26/Expript2), which is half decent, but still not as good as, [Expript3](https://github.com/Germax26/Expript3), the latest, best, and the version I am currently working on.
